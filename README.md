This is a ranking of the top neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, utilizing our own metric to arrive at a conclusion. We're concentrating our efforts on the neighborhood that will give the most recreational amennitiesÂ for the community. The Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center provided us with three different datasets. We concentrated on the datasets for the neighborhood's Playgrounds, Swimming Pools, and Courts. We determined the neighborhoods with the most courts, playgrounds, and pools, using the datasets.
